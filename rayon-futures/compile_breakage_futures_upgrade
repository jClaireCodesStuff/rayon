Upgrading the futures crate from 0.1 to 0.3 broke:

Missing:

futures::task::Task

futures::Async

futures::executor::{self, Notify, NotifyHandle, UnsafeNotify}

futures::executor::spawn

futures::task::executor

futures::task::current

Changed:
the Future trait has only a single return type, not Item/Error

No Future::wait

futures::task::Spawn doesn't have a type argument

----

futures::task::Spawn used to represent a "fused future and task".  Now it is:

 > The Spawn trait allows for pushing futures onto an executor that will run them to completion.

so it certainly no longer does the same thing

----

futures::Async

Return type of future, indicating whether a value is ready or not.

This is now

futures::Poll 

----

futures::executor::{Notify*}

These have become `Waker` and `ArcWake` and so on, see futures::task
